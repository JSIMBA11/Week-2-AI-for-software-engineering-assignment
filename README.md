![SDG 13](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/E_SDG-goals_icons-individual-rgb-13.png)

## Project Overview

This machine learning solution addresses **SDG 13: Climate Action** by predicting CO2 emissions and evaluating the impact of various sustainability interventions. The AI model helps policymakers and environmental organizations make data-driven decisions to combat climate change.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Climate change poses an existential threat to our planet. Key challenges include:
- Rising global temperatures
- Increasing CO2 emissions
- Ineffective policy interventions
- Lack of predictive tools for emission scenarios

## 🤖 AI Solution

Our solution uses **Random Forest Regression** to:
- Predict CO2 emissions based on economic and environmental factors
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different climate interventions
- Identify key drivers of emissions for targeted action
- Provide actionable insights for sustainable development

## 📊 Features Used

- GDP per capita
- Population size
- Renewable energy percentage
- Industrial output
